## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

=============================================
This project landing page dynamic navigation bar, detect sections elements on the HTML Dom and add its header section name to the navigation bar menu.

When the user clicks on the menu bar on a specific section name the page view scroll to that section rectangle or section element on the page add apply active section selected CSS specific style on that selected section adding an active class section to that selected section element and remove it from the last section where user view it if the user were viewing one of the section.
I added one element style only in the CSS file and all of the work in the js file.
and I added a JavaScript external file link on the index HTML file before the end of the page by a few lines.
and I add section 4 too on the index HTML file manually.
I have tested the movement of the activate class from one section to another section through the browser inspector tool and the getbouncingClientRect on moving/scrolling from one section to another section.
