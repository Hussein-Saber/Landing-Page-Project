## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

A project to learn how DOM manipulated by use  JavaScript dynamiclly added sections data to DOM




show you my steps on this (My) Project (Steps):

* Notes: you will find the same following steps mentioned in the code files (index.html - app.js) as a comment lines too.
kindly be informed that i ((downloaded the starter code)) and use it from (https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019) as you mentioned.

(( Lets start explaining my steps )) :

1- on file (index.html)

adding missing section 4 on starter file on the next line copying section 3 and rename it to section 4, I do that to meet the PROJECT SPECIFICATION requirements mentioned instructions on Interface and Architecture - HTML Structure - that says "There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page." and the starter code contains three sections only.


adding javascript file link on the next line, and i do that to meet the PROJECT SPECIFICATION requirements mentioned instructions (Landing Page Behavior) that says (Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.) so we must do it with javascript to be dynamically.

javascript file (app.js) I have read and follow the instructions green lines that is already made (green comments) on the started file:

 - Define Global Variables : (navigationbarList - pageSections), Tip 1) Selection of all the sections via document.querySelectorAll(‘section’);
